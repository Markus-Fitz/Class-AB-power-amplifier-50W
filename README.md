# Specs
 This Power amplifier consists of a Darlington-pair of TIP41C- and BD139-transistors and TIP42C- and BD140-transistors. This amplifier was designed for the operation with a +-24V power-supply. The voltage-amplification is done with a OpAmp, which therefore has to withstand the maximum supply voltages. A Vbe-multiplier mounted to the same heatsink is responsible for a stable bias current throung the endstage and can be adjusted for different bias current settings.
